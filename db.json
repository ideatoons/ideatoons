			"description": "The major problem youth are facing today is under-employment not the unemployment. Companies are striving to find the candidates who have basic skills to do a starter job, but they are unable to find desired number of candidates who are eligible for this basic requirement. This shows that there is definitely a gap between education and industry which is not seriously identified in last couple of decades."

			"description": "Most people are so intelligent that they are suffering their own intelligence. In spite of being capable, they will not take any initiative for creating their own identity and spend their whole life in walls of a company. We have seen many linkedin posts where people suggest company owner that their owner should do it, owner should do that etc., If you have better plans than your company's owner (who took initiative) why don't you take initiative? It infers that It's not 'mind' which makes the difference but It's 'mentality which creates difference between slaves and entrepreneurs. Following are the reasons why even capable people don't take any initiative in their whole life, They think that being an entrepreneur will require them to leave their jobs as they have read many over-motivational stories about successful people leaving everything before being successful. On other side, they spend their weekends in doing many unimportant things or doing freelancing for someone other's business for some extra money. They are always in competition of earning more package than their friends which makes them in-competitive and plays habitual game of 'monthly salary loop'. They complain that their company owner is not running the company in well manner if they would be owner of that company then they would have running it nicely. On other side, they don't dare to take any initiative and always seeks jobs in companies. They think that it is risky to start something new and enjoy the risk of spending their whole life working for someone other's business and being the headcount for shake of monthly salary. They think they will work hard in companies, gain more experience and will get chance to work in US or Developed countries and get monthly salary in dollars/euros but still can't think outside the monthly salary. On the other side, Person who took initiative, send his slaves to US for work and himself goes to bangkok for enjoy. My favourite - they will try to find spelling mistakes in my article instead of thinking about it. At conclusion, they have all the answers and excuses for not taking an initiative until they don't have sufficient pain of not taking it."

			"description": "The level of information material is growing rapidly through internet and other mediums but at the same time it has not helped as expected to raise the level of education system which has continuously degraded over period of time. \r\n Following is the history of education system,\r\n\r\nGolden Age - Gurukuls : The idea of gurukul was to teach student the most basic aspects of life like animal husbandry, yoga, medication and energy reverberating mantras. The purpose of gurukul education was to understand more higher dimensions of human capabilities which are so above than the logical intelligence.\r\nMiddle Age - Classroom Based: The idea of classroom based education is to focus on a predefined syllabus and teachers are appointed to judge them based on their capability of understanding the predefined syllabus which is imposed over them. This system has one thing in common with gurukul system that students and teachers are at least physically available in education environment.\r\nModern Age - Online Education: The idea of online education is to create the informative material by the community of people over the globe which may not necessarily belong to a formal or government entity which regularize the predefined syllabus. This system has helped the education system to be commercialised rapidly but unfortunately it could not help raise the level of education.\r\nToday we have all the electronic means available to publish our knowledge but it will not help raise the level of education system unless we don't follow the basic rules of education which don't change over time, so what are those rules,\r\n\r\nA. An effective education system in its true essence should not involve any transaction of money, otherwise it can only be business but can never be education even if we have any number of powerful tools to deliver information.\r\n\r\nB. An effective education system will focus on developing problem solving minds not the memory based or employed minds.\r\n\r\nC. People pursuing master degree who are supposed to create new opportunities for others, dream of doing a job in a company - this is the main reason of unemployment.\r\n\r\nIn order to take education system to next level, there is a need of volunteers (demanding no money) who are working in respected industry and regularly interact with students to remove the gap between education and industry.\r\n\r\nAre you an industry professional who want to be a part of this volunteer based idea to take the education system to next level?",
